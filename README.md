<b>Day 1 - IoT with Arduino with MQTT </b><br>
	1. ESP32 with Temperature sensor(DHT22) and connected with MQTT.<br>
	2. Sub and pub current temperature and humidity.<br>
	3. Simulate smart streetlight control based on sensor readings.<br>
	4. Run Python script to save IoT data as CSV logs.<br>
	<br>
<b>Day 2 - Python for Data Cleaning + OpenCV </b><br>
	1. Pandas and NumPy for dataset preprocessing, normalize sensor readings and handle missing values. <br>
	2. Plotting graphs using matplotlib, using Scikit-learn libraries include anomaly. <br>
	3. Detection using an isolation forest model. <br>
	4. Use OpenCV to capture and process image. <br>
	<br>
<b>Day 3 - Webcam Project + LLM Chatbot Development </b><br>
	1. Capturing webcam frames input and applying image transformations, such as grayscale and filtering. <br>
	2. Run Python scripts to generate and customize text with LLMs. <br>
